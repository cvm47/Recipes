            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>An award-winning single malt from the valleys of Dufftown, Scotland — Glenfiddich is the kind of drink that whispers, "You've made it... or at least you're pretending you did." Smooth, elegant, and aged just right — this isn't just a drink. It's a slow clap in a glass. Whether you're pairing it with silence, jazz, or questionable life choices — Glenfiddich delivers flavor with a smirk.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>60ml Glenfiddich Single Malt Scotch, measured with deliberate care.</li>
                    <li>2 large ice cubes, solid enough to outlast the conversation.</li>
                    <li>1 clean and pristine whisky glass, polished like it’s sacred.</li>
                    <li>Water, optional of course, but always suspicious when requested.</li>
                    <li>A cigar paired with silence, because noise ruins good smoke.</li>
                    <li>A wooden chair pulled close, steady and unpretentious in its duty.</li>
                    <li>Dim lighting that softens the edges of both drink and thought.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose your setting - </strong>Sit somewhere quiet and less dramatic, where even the furniture seems to respect the ritual.</li>
                <li><strong>Pour 60ml Glenfiddich into the glass - </strong>Use precision as if you’re conducting science, but with far better outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Add ice cube - </strong>If you’re feeling cinematic, drop the ice in and admire how slowly time—and whisky—can melt away.</li>
                <li><strong>Swirl gently - </strong>Not to mix, but to look enigmatic and reflective, the kind of person people write poems about.</li>
                <li><strong>Sip slow and steady - </strong>Let the flavors roll across your tongue: oak, vanilla, honey, and the faint echo of distant Scottish winds.</li>
                <li><strong>Close your eyes - </strong>Allow the taste to stretch into memory, painting landscapes of misty hills you’ve never actually visited.</li>
            </ol>
